Having an avid interest in Ubisoft's [Rainbow Six Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege), a highly tactical first-person shooter, I've dedicated significant time to mastering its intricacies. <br/>

However, I understand that the game's steep learning curve can be challenging for newcomers. <br/>

That's why I'm excited to share a new tool I've been working on called [SiegeGPT](https://siegegpt.joqim.com/), which utilizes [ChatGPT's](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) OpenAI API and [Vercel's](https://vercel.com) edge functions to generate dynamic gameplay strategies tailored to specific maps and bomb sites.

With over 8 years of development, Rainbow Six Siege has evolved into a complex and strategic experience. <br/>


Through SiegeGPT, I aim to provide valuable assistance to fellow players by leveraging cutting-edge technology. By selecting the desired map and bomb site, SiegeGPT generates real-time strategies that can enhance gameplay and improve decision-making.

I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of gaming and technology, and this project showcases my ability to utilize emerging technologies to enhance gaming experiences.
